  - Fixed install-time environment for assertions

0.32 2014-03-30T00:30:16Z

  - Merge command of mist is now full-featured
    This includes using its mistfile to install the foreign distribution
		and merge this file into the local one

0.31 2014-03-29T17:16:27Z

  - Added --prove option to mpan-install tht runs tests after install
    Especially useful as: (best run this overnight, it might take ages)
		  ./mpan-install --prove --all-available-versions

0.30 2014-03-29T04:51:33Z

  - Full merging of prepend, notest and cpanfile requirements
    This finally gives use notest for prepend, keeps all version information
    even if it comes from different sources (e.g. prepend now uses version
    requirements from cpanfile if no other is given).
 
  - Display usage text and version info with ./mpan-install --help

0.29 2014-03-29T01:32:19Z

  - Removed all instances of PERLBREW_HOME, it is not needed for mist
  - Once again install one module at a time so requirements will be sorted
    out correctly
  - mist itself now respects active branch
  - include local::lib so that mist is now fully self-contained
	
  Changes to mpan-install:
  - Consistent handling of @ARGV
  - Added --all-available-versions
  - changed --perl to --perlbrew so it does not clash with cpanm's option
  - Now supports installing of single modules
  - perlbrew script once again supports --perlbrew=system to
    disable use of perlbrew altogether
