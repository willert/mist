Huge Catalyst-based web project, huge differences between staging and master:

Without --parent:

time ./mpan-install --branch staging-without-parent 
441 distributions installed
user	31m21.239s
sys	4m25.095s

du -hsc perl-5.14.2-x86_64-linux-master/ perl-5.14.2-x86_64-linux-staging-without-parent/
291M	total

With --parent:

time ./mpan-install --branch staging --parent master
74 distributions installed
user	14m56.295s
sys	1m19.553s

du -hsc perl-5.14.2-x86_64-linux-master/ perl-5.14.2-x86_64-linux-staging/

Also:

Creating a new local::lib from a parent much closer resembles what will happen at merge
time than recreating the whole tree, allowing you to catch errors before trying to go live.
